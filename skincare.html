		<p><p>A holistic <a href="http://www.drhauschka.com/" target="new">Dr. Hauschka</a> facial cleanses, clarifies, rejuvenates, and rebalances your skin to its inherent radiance and beauty. It is not an ordinary facial treatment. It will make you feel centered and relaxed; your skin will feel refreshed and radiant long after the actual procedure is over.</p>
		<p>The treatment routine is based on special techniques that rebalance and regulate the natural functions of your skin with pure organic and biodynamically grown plant materials. The result will be a healthy and beautifully glowing complexion.</p> 
		
		<div class="read_more">
		<p>A Dr. Hauschka treatment is not a quick fix that would force change, mask symptoms, or conceal conditions, subjecting your skin into a dependency, undermining the immune system, and making the underlying conditions worse. Instead, a Dr. Hauschka facial begins to reeducate your skin so that it can remember its intrinsic wisdom, enabling it to heal and rejuvenate itself. The Dr. Hauschka products cooperate with your bodyâ€™s natural rhythms and functions to guide your skin back to glowing health.</p>
		<p>All skincare products for home care are available at the studio.</p>

		<h2><a name="classic">Classic treatment</a></h2>
		<p>This 2-hour procedure not only beautifies your skin, it also carries you away to a land of absolute relaxation and bliss, totally enveloping you with a feeling of well-being.</p>
		<div class="read_more">
		<p>After your soothing foot bath, I give you a gentle leg-and-foot and arm-and-hand massage, and I apply warm aromatherapy compresses on your d&eacute;collet&eacute; and face. I cleanse the entire area with fermented grain milk, almond paste, and herbal clay, and I give a rhythmical brush and a press-and-roll hand massage to your face and neck to support the natural flow of lymph.</p>
		<p>Based on your skin type, I determine the type of treatment mask, the rhythmitised conditioner, and the moisturizer.</p>
		<p>While your mask sinks in, I bathe your eye area in an herbal infusion concocted with eyebright and fennel, specifically to refresh your eyes and tighten both upper and lower eyelids. I apply lip balm not only to nourish your lips but also to moisturize and feed the upper lip area.</p>
		<p>This treatment is the climax of pampering skincare.</p>

		<h2><a name="cleansing">Cleansing treatment</a></h2>
		<p>This 1&frac12;-hour treatment not only purifies your complexion but relaxes your whole being. I give you a sage foot bath that draws stress away from your face and head. I soften the facial pores with herbal steam compresses, and I draw out the impurities with therapeutic clay. Any necessary extractions are then very gentle but effective. Detoxification through lymph stimulation follows. A skin-specific conditioner supports the skin's own balancing and healing functions.</p>
		<p>The treatment mask that follows results in a radiant complexion that is deeply cleansed and that feels refreshed and renewed.</p>

I apply cleansing clay as well as rhythmic conditioners selected specifically for your skin condition. I gently extract blackheads. The treatment reduces blemishes.
